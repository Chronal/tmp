# Introduction
Warning hacking can be illegal, please do so responsibly and at your own risk.

## Step 0 - Install linux
Linux is a kernel not an operating system.

A linux distribution is a software package containing the linux kernel along with a (typically GNU) userland to go with it.

Some commonly used distributions are:
- Ubuntu - The beginner friendly starting point (based on debian)
- Arch - Minimal, you'll have to put it together yourself kit (has a great wiki)
- Debian - Stable, used on servers
- Kali - A pentester's best friend
- Gentoo - The compile it yourself one

In order to tackle security you'll want to get comfortable with:
- Living in the terminal
	- bash, pipes, redirections... etc
- Programming languages:
	- C to understand how most of the software on your computer is built
	- Python for scripting tasks
	- x86 assembly for low level shenanigans and debugging C

## Step 1 - Learn things!
Listed here are some USYD security subjects. Use these resources to learn the basics of security.
- [elec5616](https://elec5616.com/lectures.html): Computer and Network Security,Theory Based Large amounts of information relating to security
- comp5618: Applied Cybersecurity, Quality course, it is a continuation of elec5615. Focuses more on practical work.

More resources can be found [here.](../resources)

## Step 2- Apply what you learnt
Participate in some capture the flags (CTF). A ctf is series of security puzzles. Here are some to checkout:
- [Bandit CTF](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/): Extremely good ctf that focuses on terminal skills. Done via ssh which forces you to only use the terminal.
- [Google CTF](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/)

## Summary
- Install Linux
- Learn to program
- Get comfortable with the terminal
- Learn about security by reading books/course material
- Apply what you learnt in CTFs
